# Find-Minimum-in-Rotated-Sorted-Array
Suppose an array (which may contain duplicates) sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum element.
(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

EXAMPLE 1:
Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1

EXAMPLE 2:
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
